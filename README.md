# LLM Poker

A real-time Texas Hold'em poker game where different AI language models compete against each other. Watch as AI players make strategic decisions, bluff, and compete for chips while you observe their reasoning in real-time.

## 🎮 Features

- **Live AI vs AI Gameplay**: Six different language models play Texas Hold'em autonomously
- **Real-time Web Interface**: Watch games unfold with live updates and animations
- **AI Reasoning Display**: See what each AI is thinking as they make decisions
- **Equity Calculations**: Real-time win probability calculations for each hand
- **Historical Analysis**: Track performance across multiple games
- **Beautiful UI**: Modern, responsive interface with smooth animations

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Frontend (`/app`)
- **Next.js 15** with App Router
- **Real-time updates** via InstantDB
- **Components**:
  - Live game visualization
  - Player cards and chip stacks
  - Community cards display
  - AI reasoning viewer
  - Historical game browser
  - Performance analytics

### Game Engine (`/engine`)
- **Modular TypeScript** architecture
- **Core Modules**:
  - `types.ts` - Type definitions for game state
  - `constants.ts` - Game configuration and AI models
  - `game-setup.ts` - Game initialization
  - `round-manager.ts` - Round orchestration
  - `betting-round.ts` - Betting logic and pot management
  - `ai-player.ts` - AI decision making interface
  - `showdown.ts` - Hand evaluation and winner determination
  - `utils.ts` - Helper functions

### Backend (`/trigger`)
- **Trigger.dev** for game orchestration
- Manages game flow and AI API calls
- Handles database updates

## 🤖 AI Models

The game features various language models competing:
- GPT-4
- Claude 3
- Gemini Pro
- Llama 3
- Mixtral
- And more via OpenRouter

Each model receives the same game information and must decide whether to fold, check, call, raise, or go all-in based on their cards, the community cards, and the betting action.

## 🎯 Game Flow

1. **Pre-flop**: Each player receives 2 hole cards
2. **Flop**: 3 community cards are revealed
3. **Turn**: 4th community card is revealed
4. **River**: Final community card is revealed
5. **Showdown**: Best hand wins the pot

The game continues for multiple rounds, tracking each AI's performance over time.

## 🗄️ Database Schema

Uses InstantDB for real-time data synchronization:
- `games` - Overall game state and configuration
- `players` - AI players and their chip stacks
- `gameRounds` - Individual poker hands
- `hands` - Player hole cards
- `bettingRounds` - Betting action for each phase
- `actions` - Individual player decisions
- `transactions` - Chip movements and pot distributions
